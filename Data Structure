####    LIST --->>>  list() ---it is a data type  ---->>>MUTABLE  (CAN CHANGE ITS DATATYPE)
#  we can make list by assigning diff types of elements in [] <<---- this brackets
#
# sl = [1,5,"hello",6]
# sl1= [2,6,9,"hello"]
#
# ll = [sl,sl1]
#
# print(ll[1][2])



####TUPLE ----->>>>> is immutable but have lots of functions in it!!!!!!!

# to check its functions use the dir() function

# t= 1,2,3,4
# print(dir(t))
# print(type(t))
#
# for a single element------->>>
#
# t = 1,
# print(t,type(t))
