# How to take Inputs---->>

# name = input("Your Name = ")
# age = input("Your Age = ")
# height = input("Your Height = ")
# info = input("All the Input are Correct (True,False) = ")

#print("Your Name is ",type(name))
#print("Your Age is ",type(age))
#print("Your Height is ",type(height))
#print("Your info's are ",type(info))

# ****IMPORTANT POINT Here we have to notice that we take any input from keyboard will consider as a string type

# How to Classify input datatype---->>
#
# age = int(input("Your Age = "))
# print("Your age type is ",type(age))


## ***RULES--->>
# 1. We can type capital or small, any type of letter or words, it doesnt matter
# 2. Every Variable has its own id such that ---> AGE & age are not same ,they both have different id
# 3. Variables names never start  with numbers ---> 1name-->(False), But at the end or middle it is possible ---> na1me1-->(True)
# 4. We cant assign a special charachter in the variable ---> name@-->(False)
# 5. Only Underscroll Will work :: your_name-->(True)
# 6. If any keyword have predefined meaning then it will not use as a variable:::
#    print = "shubham"
#    print(,print)


###****We can know the reference or address id's of variables --->>

# name = "shubham"
# NAME = "shubham"
# print("name = ",id(name),"NAME = ",id(NAME))
